# üîß MongoDB Atlas Setup Checklist

## Current Status: Authentication Failed ‚ùå

Your connection string format is correct, but authentication is failing. Here's what to check:

## 1. Verify Database User in MongoDB Atlas

### Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard:
1. Visit [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project/cluster

### Check Database Access:
1. Click "Database Access" in the left sidebar
2. Look for user: `atusarun_db_user`
3. **If the user doesn't exist:**
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Choose "Password" authentication
   - Username: `atusarun_db_user`
   - Password: `994352Arun`
   - Database User Privileges: "Built-in Role" ‚Üí "Read and write to any database"
   - Click "Add User"

4. **If the user exists but authentication fails:**
   - Click "Edit" next to the user
   - Reset the password to: `994352Arun`
   - Make sure privileges are "Read and write to any database"
   - Click "Update User"

## 2. Verify Network Access

1. Click "Network Access" in the left sidebar
2. **Make sure you have an entry that shows:**
   - IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Comment: "Allow access from anywhere"
3. **If you don't see this:**
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Click "Confirm"

## 3. Check Cluster Status

1. Go to "Database" (or "Clusters")
2. Make sure your cluster shows "Active" not "Paused"
3. If paused, click the "Resume" button

## 4. Alternative Connection String Format

If the above doesn't work, try this alternative format (sometimes helps):

```
mongodb+srv://atusarun_db_user:994352Arun@cluster0.5edi790.mongodb.net/figma-portfolio?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

(Remove the `&appName=Cluster0` part)

## 5. Test with MongoDB Compass

1. Download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
2. Use the same connection string to test if it works outside of our app
3. If Compass can connect, then the issue is in our Node.js code
4. If Compass can't connect, then it's a MongoDB Atlas configuration issue

## Quick Actions Needed:

1. ‚úÖ **Double-check database user exists** (`atusarun_db_user`)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify password is exactly** `994352Arun`
3. ‚úÖ **Confirm user has read/write permissions**
4. ‚úÖ **Ensure IP whitelist includes** `0.0.0.0/0`
5. ‚úÖ **Check cluster is active** (not paused)

Once you've verified all the above, run this test again:
```bash
node detailed-test.js
```
